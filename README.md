### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Davide, I am a data scientist with a bagkground in Phyisics and Neuroscience, currently working at the [Donders Centre for Neuroscience](https://www.ru.nl/science/dcn/) in Nijmegen (NL). 

Here are some things I've been building of late:

- :microscope: [pipeline_2p](https://github.com/NeuroNetMem/pipeline_2p) is a python pipeline for the segmentation of large brain imaging videos, based on [CaImAn](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn)
- :wrench: [pipeline_vsdi](https://github.com/NeuroNetMem/pipeline_2p) is a collection of tools for handling and analyzing whole-cortex videos acquired with Voltage Sensitive Dye Imaging.
- :black_nib: [Neural Data Science](https://neural-data-science-course.github.io/) is an open-source course on ML methods for neuroscientist, that I have been developing as a fellow of the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/)
